### GORILA

GORILA is Louis **G**odart and Jean-Pierre **O**livier's ***R**ecueil des **i**nscriptions en **L**inéaire **A***, published from 1976 to 1985 in *Études Crétoises*. The text's five volumes constitute the most complete corpus of Linear A inscriptions.

### Linear A

[Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A) is an undeciphered Cretan writing system believed to have been used from around 1800 BC to 1400 BC. The language encoded by the script is often referred to as Minoan. The script was succeeded by [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B), which was deciphered by Michael Ventris in the 1950s.

### Problem

Thanks to its authors, GORILA is available [online](https://cefael.efa.gr/result.php?site_id=1&serie_id=EtCret) for free. Unfortunately, the text is hard to navigate: the website only offers navigation between individual pages, which quickly becomes unwieldy given that the volumes are close to 2,000 pages long in total.

### Solution

This repository contains a script that can be used to scrape the images and combine them into 5 PDFs (one per volume). For ease of access, the repository also contains the 5 PDFs (see the "volumes" folder).

To my knowledge, this is the only place online where GORILA is available as a PDF. Enjoy!
